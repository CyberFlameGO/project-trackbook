## INTERVIEW 2

***User interviews and prototype demo feedback***

**Administered at:** eLife Innovation Sprint
**On:** 11th May 2018

Hi, thank you for taking part in our Project Trackbook interviews!!

We're going to ask you a few questions about yourself, and then show you a prototype we've developed for our idea. We're really interested in any feedback you can give - positive or negative!

We're asking for your feedback early so that we can build something you would actually use :smile:

Let's start by asking a few questions about you:

1. What is your name. Do you consent to us using this information publicly?

> Daniela - yes!

2. What is your job? Please interpret this very broadly - you can define yourself however you want.

> PhD student in neuroscience. Set up experiments using electrophysiology to study the auditory system - these last 6-7 hours. There's also some data that we'd collect that will be analysed that evening - spike sorting etc.

>Other days are analysis or prepwork.


What we want to achieve for the Project Trackbook is a lab book for the modern age. Our two priorities are 1) secure and easy file sharing with collaborators, and 2) version control.

As a key side effect of these priorities we want to also facilitate sharing of all the information a re-user would need to understand your project *without you being there*. Therefore we want to prioritise data management and metadata capture alongside the original and processed data files.

3. What does useful data sharing meant to you? Would you value this sort of tool? Which aspects of our description resonate most strongly with you?

> I really like the capture of the metadata & comments.

> I can imagine that for a human lab it's really really important to stay super secure. It needs to be secure. There are quite a few tools that we're not allowed to use because they're hosted by 3rd party servers (eg: google docs, dropbox etc).

4. What tools do you currently use to share files with collaborators?

> Code - git & bitbucket. Open source projects are in github and the closed projects are on bitbucket. Many of these "closed" projects are old scripts that are very specfic for work in the lab.

> To share files we use slack within the lab. For example in specific project channels.

5. How do you manage data within your research group?

> My PI is quite tech savy - we have a local server with a database and we log in and track the ID of the experiment and the time and date. Then there are prompts to ensure that we write down the important things that we need to record.

> I also take notes on paper - I personally like to be able to draw some of the concepts. Not everyone does it. I also like to have a history of everything that I've been doing. To be honest, I think it's partly because this was how I was trained. I just find it easier to flick through the pages of the lab book to be able to easily go through the 

> The main database captures really valuable metadata in a standard form. It is possible to upload images that I've taken from the experiment etc.


6. What improvements or changes would you make to your current workflow? What limitations or bloskers do you encounter and/or what do you want to be able to do. 

> I think it would be great to be able to customise the main database. I'd like to be able to set it up the way that *I* would like to interact with it.

Let me show you the prototype we've developed. 

As we go through the demo, please speak out loud what you're thinking (if you can!) and let us know what makes sense and what questions you have.

The scenario we're imagining: A PhD student wants to share a figure they've created with their supervisor.

This file can not be shared through a cloud service because there is sensitive data involved in the figure. The student wants to keep track of the versions of the file as it develops.

[INSERT PROTOTYPE DEMO HERE!]

We'll open the Beaker Browser and navigate to the specific hash link for your project.

You can see on the left the 

> This looks like a scaffold for a paper. Get all your framing for a project set up from the beginning.
> I think it would be really valuable to have that scaffold from the

> DANIELLE: integrate with the eLife reproducible paper stack? THis is another way to collect papercomponensts

Project space - information about project, files in folders organized by the user, plus version information

>Are these are files related to this project? Daniela wants high level info on the left and low level on the right

Adding a filenot tracked yet, 

>What does it mean? Doesn't know what 'not tracked' means - it's not being assigned an id for version control?
>yes, I think I do know what it means

The warning in the descriptions section, updates in that section, user can edit this section to address new the files. Committing the changes added here, committing to version history. Sumarize what has been changed

> Is it required to add a comment? it should be. many people are being required, must have required comments

Now we commit changes

>IS this number the total revisions - is this a revision by everyone who has access or by you? all revisions done by anyone. \unless it it only you who has shared the project

Now to add new users to share your file, send them an email with the hash or add email addresses to send the key

> Make revisions and changes? Do they need to accept in order to become a collaborator? Yes, she wants them to confirm their addition

Once they have been added they know the hash key and can access the data. two days later.... you access the project again and see a revision. now this thing you collaborator adds is tracked by the version history

>This can be any type of files? any files in any folder straucture that you want, if it was a funky file type, an illustrator file type, it would ask how you want to open it

Every project has the same layout, but you can add as many panels as you want. these panels would be long, so first few displayed plus click to expand
